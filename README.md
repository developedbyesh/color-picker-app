# Color Picker App

A simple web-based color picker application where users can select a color, and the chosen color is displayed as the background of a preview box, along with its hexadecimal color code. This app is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- Allows users to select a color using an intuitive color input field.
- Displays the selected color in a preview box with the corresponding hex code.
- Updates the background color of the preview box dynamically as the user selects a different color.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the color picker input and display elements.
- **CSS**: Styles the color input, preview box, and the overall layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handles real-time color updates and displays the color code.

## How It Works

1. The user selects a color using the color picker input.
2. The background color of the preview box changes to the selected color.
3. The hexadecimal value of the selected color is displayed beneath the preview box.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main structure of the app, including the color input, preview box, and color code display.
- **style.css**: Defines the styling for the container, color picker, preview box, and text elements.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic that dynamically updates the preview box and displays the hex color code.
